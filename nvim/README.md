# Intro

This is a work in progress for converting all my neovim configs over to pure lua.
I run a pretty sparse configuration as it stands, I am currently working to streamline
it a bit more and solidify it a bit. Make it more reasonable and maintainable,
taking advantage of Lua to keep modules and submodules small.

- Entry point: **init.lua**
- Primary module: **thismat**

# thismat module structure

| Level | Submodule | Purpose | References |
| ----- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| root  | **options**   | Setup all the vim options I prefer |
| root  | **plugins**   | Plugin management |
| root  | **colors**   | Colorscheme customization |
| root  | **lsp**   | LSP configuration, this is responsible for loading thismat.lsp.* level sudmoules |
| |
| lsp   | **capabilities** | Used for configuring the capabilities of the LSP server |
| lsp   | **completion** | Configure completion plugin(s) |
| lsp   | **lua** | Setup Lua LSP | thismat.lsp.capabilities |

These are the plugins I prefer for sure and aren't likely to change unless something
new comes along that catches my eye.
